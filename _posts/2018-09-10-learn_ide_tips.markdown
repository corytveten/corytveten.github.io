The learn IDE environment can be tricky and frustrating. Here are some general tips and solutions to problems I have encountered.

* Cutting and pasting in terminal: Use cmd+shift+v on Mac or ctrl+shift+v on pc to paste. Cmd+shift+c on Mac or ctrl+shift+c on pc to copy.

* At times the command line at the bottom of the terminal is not visible. Hover the mouse cursor over the line separating the top of the terminal section and the bottom of the code section. The cursor will change to an arrow pointing up and down. Click and hold the mouse to drag the barrier line up until you see the command line re-appear as the terminal expands.

*  Re-open a lab you have previously completed with the tests re-set: [here](https://corytveten.github.io/re-loading_a_lab)

* Try using the split screen. Right click/cmd-click a file in the directory on the left of the screen and a drop down menu appears with the option to "Split RIght." This will allow you to have two tabs open side by side. It can be especially helpful to have the spec file open to review the tests while you code along.

* Type "learn --f-f" rather than "learn" in the command line to see only the next test that needs to be passed.
