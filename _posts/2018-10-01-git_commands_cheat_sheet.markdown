Here are some basic git commands to enter into the terminal.

* git init – create a new git repository.
* git status – check the status of changes within the working directory
* git add – add a file to the staging area. When you have made changes to files and are ready to commit them, send them to the staging area. Enter ‘git add’ followed by the name of the file.
* git diff – check the differences between the working directory and the staging area. Enter git diff followed by the name of the file.
* git commit – permanently store changes from the staging area to a repository. Enter ‘git commit -m’ followed by a message in quotation marks describing the changes made. Convention dictates that you use present tense here, e.g. ‘write new code’ rather than ‘wrote new code.’
* git log – view chronological list of previous commits.
* git checkout HEAD – restore the file in your working directory to its status at the last commit. Enter ‘git checkout HEAD’ followed by the name of the file.
* git reset – remove a file from the staging area. Enter ‘git reset HEAD’ followed by the name of the file that has been added to the staging area.
