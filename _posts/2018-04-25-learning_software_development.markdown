Before last year, the field of computer programming was utterly foreign to me. It was not intimidating. It was unthinkable. It was something that other people, with a different mental toolset than mine, went into. I consider myself a capable person, but I studied English in college, software engineering was not an option for me.

My mind began to change when I spoke with a few friends who had begun to study software development. These included people with similar professional and educational backgrounds as mine, and this allowed me to engage with a field I had previously ignored.  People that I identified with were moving into computer programming, and gradually, I was able to allow myself to think about the possibilities of software engineering. I casually took some courses through Codecademy and other free online resources and immediately found points of interest that further opened my mind to the idea of coding.

Specifically, I found myself attracted to the language aspects of programming. The idea of syntax and semantics are central to both programming and natural languages. I am not able to go into detailed discussion of the relationship between the two; in fact, I admit my recognition of an analogy between the two is superficial. Nevertheless, thinking about the new-to-me field of software development in this context allowed me an entry point. 

So, now that I have opened these new mental pathways and begun to conceptualize myself as a computer programmer, the field is no longer unthinkable, it is now simply intimidating.
