Here are some useful commands to enter into the terminal:

* pwd – print working directory. This command will print the path of the directory you are currently working out of.
* ls – list files and directories. This command will list the files and directories of the current working directory.
* cd – change directory. This command, followed by name of a directory, will switch your current working directory to the one named. In order to move back to a directory directly above the current working directory, enter “cd ..” in the command line
* mkdir – make directory. This command, followed by a new directory name, will create a new directory within your current working directory.
* touch – make file. This command, followed by a new file name, will create a new file within your current working directory.
* rm – remove. Use this command, followed by a file or directory name, to delete the file or directory.
